Final Project
Here are the requirements for the different types of projects:

Novel Problem:

1) A short report, max 5 pages, explaining your problem, mathematical formulation, results, shortcomings of the model, and future research ideas. (If you submit an exceptional project, it may be used in the upcoming courses as a part of "Extend a Previous Project." )

2) Excel file,

3) A video explaining your model detail and results. 

In this project, you can get a higher score by (1) solving a complex problem, (2) use real or realistic data for your analysis. 

Expand Your Knowledge

1) You must solve either one problem from each ICE or solve one ICE in its entirety using another software. You must submit your code. 

2) A video explaining every unique line in your code. You do not need to explain every line in every question. You only need to explain the lines that are different. For example, the difference between integer linear and linear programming is the integer restrictions on the decision variables. When explaining, integer linear programming, you only need to explain the line of code that restricts the decision variables to integers. (The rest of the code would already be similar to linear programming.)

In this project, you can get a higher score by learning an advanced feature of the software. (Of course, if you learned more, you will get a higher score.)

Discussion of an Existing Application

1) Video explaining the model in detail.  (You must understand and explain the logic of each function and constraint.)

Usually, these models are much more complex than we discussed in class. You will get a high score if you are able to describe the logic of every constraint.  

Expansion of a group project from previous terms

1) A short report, max 5 pages, explaining your problem, mathematical formulation, results, shortcomings of the model, and future research ideas. (If you submit an exceptional project, it may be used in the upcoming courses as a part of "Extend a Previous Project." )

2) Excel file,

3) A video explaining your model detail and results. 

In this project, you can get a higher score by (1) solving a complex problem, (2) use real or realistic data for your analysis. 

Due date: same day/time as the final exam for your section.
